# Kanban Board Application

This is a Kanban board application designed to help you organize tasks and improve productivity. It allows users to create, update, and manage tasks across boards.

## New Feature: Authentication

I've added user authentication to enhance security. Now, you can:

- Sign up and log into your account.
- Access your own board and tasks.

## Features

- Create and manage tasks on a board.
- User authentication for secure access.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run the application with `npm start`.
